# Secure Notes Fullstack Application (Frontend)

Hi, this is the frontend of the project named **secure-notes-fullstack**, which includes both frontend and backend components. Make sure to also clone and run the backend repository linked below for a complete working solution.

🎨 **How to Run the Frontend (React JS)**

### Step 1: Clone and Enter the Project Folder

Clone this repository if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/secure-notes-frontend.git
cd secure-notes-frontend
```

### Step 2: Install Node Modules

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. To verify, use:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

After confirming Node.js and npm are installed, run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend Server

Start the development server using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application at:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

If port 3000 is already in use, React will prompt you to use another available port — allow it to proceed.

🧠 **Connect to the Backend**

The frontend communicates with the backend hosted at:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Make sure your FastAPI backend is running on that port.

If necessary, update the base URL in the frontend code (likely in a file like `api.js`) to match your backend URL.

📁 **Folder Structure (Quick Glance)**

- `components/`       --> All reusable components
- `pages/`            --> Login, Register, Dashboard, etc.
- `App.js`            --> Main app file
- `index.js`          --> Entry point for React

The structure is simple and clean, designed to help you understand and extend the codebase easily.

❗ **Heads Up**

- This project was built using VSCode, and it is recommended to run it there for a smooth development experience.
- If VSCode suggests missing extensions or ESLint setup, feel free to install them.
- Ensure the backend is running first to allow the frontend's features (like login and notes sync) to function correctly.

And that’s it! 🎉

You now have the frontend of the Secure Notes App up and running, fully connected with the backend 🚀
